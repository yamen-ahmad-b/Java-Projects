## 📖 Project Description
A simple project demonstrating the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java.  
The project includes a `Car` class and a `Main` class to create multiple cars and test their functionality.

---

## 📂 Files
- `src/Car.java` → Contains the `Car` class with properties and methods such as `start()`, `stop()`, and `showInfo()`.  
- `src/Main.java` → Contains the main program to create different cars and test their actions.

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).  
2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.  

---

## 📝 Notes
- Each car is an independent object of the `Car` class.  
- You can create unlimited cars with different properties.  
- This project is a practical example of using **OOP concepts**:  
  - Classes & Objects  
  - Properties & Methods  
  - Encapsulation (basic idea)  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Here are some ideas to extend this project:  
- Add more car behaviors (e.g., `accelerate()`, `brake()`, `refuel()`).  
- Create an inheritance hierarchy (e.g., `ElectricCar` and `GasCar`).  
- Introduce **polymorphism** to handle different car types dynamically.  
- Add user interaction to control cars via console input.
