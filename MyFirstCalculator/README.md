# MyFirstCalculator

A simple **Java console application** that demonstrates the basics of programming logic and user input/output.  
This project allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations:

- ➕ **Addition**  
- ➖ **Subtraction**  
- ✖️ **Multiplication**  
- ➗ **Division**

---

## 📂 Files
- `src/Main.java` → Contains the main program logic for the calculator.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).  
2. Compile and run **Main.java**.  
3. Follow the console instructions to input numbers and select an operation.

---

## 📝 Notes
- This project is designed for learning Java basics such as **variables, conditionals, and methods**.  
- You can extend the calculator by adding more operations, for example:
  - Modulus (`%`)  
  - Square root (`√`)  
  - Power (`^`)  

---

## 📖 Learning Goals
- Practice **Java syntax** and console I/O with `Scanner`.  
- Understand **basic control flow** (`if`, `switch`).  
- Work with **methods** to organize code.
