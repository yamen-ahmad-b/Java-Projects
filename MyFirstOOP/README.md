# MyFirstOOP

## Project Description
A simple project demonstrating the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.  
The project includes a `Car` class and a `Main` class to create multiple cars and test their functionality.

## Files
- `src/Car.java` : Contains the Car class with properties and methods such as `start()`, `stop()`, and `showInfo()`.
- `src/Main.java` : Contains the main program to create different cars and test their actions.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).  
2. Run the `Main.java` file to execute the program.

## Notes
- Each car is an independent object of the `Car` class.  
- You can create unlimited cars with different properties.  
- This project is a practical example of using **OOP**, **objects**, and **methods** in Java.
